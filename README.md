## Design Stage

### Wireframes

#### Header and Navbar menu

The navbar menu was hidden with hamburger icon until triggered for mobile and tablet screen sizes. The navbar was presented in its full width for laptops and desktops.

#### Home section

The idea was to have a landing page with hero image, a heading and a paragraph. The mobile and tablet versions would look almost identical with minor adjustments added such as different font-size and image size. For the laptop and desktop versions, the image and text content would be displayed side by side.

#### Biography section

The biography section contained a heading, text content and images that were presented in rows. The size of the text and images was changing depending on what type of screen size the user had. For mobile and tablet, it took all the width of the screen while for laptop and desktop, the content is centred.

#### Work section

The work section contained a heading, text content and images that were presented in a row and positioned to go one after other. The size of the text and images was changing depending on what type of screen size the user had. For mobile and tablet, it was presented in one column while for laptop and desktop, the content was put into two separate columns.

#### Quotes section

![Screenshot of the quotes section's wireframe of the website using Balsamiq.](README-images/quotes-section-wireframe.png)

The quotes section contained a heading, text content and one image. The size of the text and image was changing depending on what type of screen size the user had. For mobile, the image took half the height of the screen. For tablet, it was positioned on the right side of the screen while for laptop and desktop, the all content took the same height of the screen size and was positioned side by side.

#### Subscribe section and Footer

![Screenshot of the footer and subscribe section's wireframe of the website using Balsamiq.](README-images/subscribe-section-wireframe.png)

The subscribe section contained a heading, text content and form that were presented in a column. The size of text content and form was changing depending on what type of screen size the user had. The main elements that were adjusted were the inputs and button. For the footer, the size of social-media icons was the only thing I had to adjust.

### Color Palette

I chose these six colours because I thought that they suited the theme of my website as most of my images were in black and white. I also thought that they complement each other very well.

### Final Design

#### Mobile

#### Desktop

For the font, I used the Baskervville and Marcellus font families. The text was in black and white colours depending on what background colour the section had. All the sections had contrast between each other as well.

#### Things that were changed while developing the website

* The hero image on a landing page looks different in the deployed version as the first image that I used turned out to be very pixelated. It also has a lot more space around it in tablet and desktop versions.
* The images in the Biography section for desktop have some space around them for stylistic purpose.
* The work section for desktop no white background as there is no need to add that much negative space.
* The quotes section for tablet and desktop looks different as I decided to center the image.
* There is no white background in the subscribe section as I thought there is no need for contrast there.
