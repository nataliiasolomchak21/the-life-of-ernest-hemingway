The Life of Ernest Hemingway is a website that includes evidence-based information about the life of one of the greatest authors of the 20th century.

The idea was to have a landing page with hero image, a heading and a paragraph. The mobile and tablet versions would look almost identical with minor adjustments added such as diffrent font-size and image size. For the laptop and desktop version the image and text content would be displayed next to each other.
