## Design Stage

### Wireframes

#### Header and Navbar menu

![Screenshot of the header and navbar menu's wireframe of the website using Balsamiq.](README-images/navbar-wireframe.png)

The navbar menu was hidden with hamburger icon until triggered for mobile and tablet screen sizes. The navbar was presented in its full width for laptops and desktops.

#### Home section

![Screenshot of the home section's wireframe of the website using Balsamiq.](README-images/home-section-wireframe.png)

The idea was to have a landing page with hero image, a heading and a paragraph. The mobile and tablet versions would look almost identical with minor adjustments added such as different font-size and image size. For the laptop and desktop versions, the image and text content would be displayed side by side.

#### Biography section

![Screenshot of the biography section's wireframe of the website using Balsamiq.](README-images/biography-section-wireframe.png)

The biography section contained a heading, text content and images that were presented in rows. The size of the text and images was changing depending on what type of screen size the user had. For mobile and tablet, it took all the width of the screen while for laptop and desktop, the content is centred.

#### Work section

![Screenshot of the work section's wireframe of the website using Balsamiq.](README-images/work-section-wireframe.png)

The work section contained a heading, text content and images that were presented in a row and positioned to go one after other. The size of the text and images was changing depending on what type of screen size the user had. For mobile and tablet, it was presented in one column while for laptop and desktop, the content was put into two separate columns.

#### Quotes section

![Screenshot of the quotes section's wireframe of the website using Balsamiq.](README-images/quotes-section-wireframe.png)

The quotes section contained a heading, text content and one image. The size of the text and image was changing depending on what type of screen size the user had. For mobile, the image took half the height of the screen. For tablet, it was positioned on the right side of the screen while for laptop and desktop, the all content took the same height of the screen size and was positioned side by side.

#### Subscribe section and Footer

![Screenshot of the footer and subscribe section's wireframe of the website using Balsamiq.](README-images/subscribe-section-wireframe.png)

The subscribe section contained a heading, text content and form that were presented in a column. The size of text content and form was changing depending on what type of screen size the user had. The main elements that were adjusted were the inputs and button. For the footer, the size of social-media icons was the only thing I had to adjust.

### Color Palette

![Screenshot of color palette of the website using Adobe Color.](README-images/color-palette.png)

I chose these six colours because I thought that they suited the theme of my website as most of my images were in black and white. I also thought that they complement each other very well.

### Final Design

#### Mobile (360x640)

![Screenshot of final design of the website for mobile using Figma.](README-images/figma-design-mobile-one.png)
![Screenshot of final design of the website for mobile using Figma.](README-images/figma-design-mobile-two.png)

#### Tablet (744x1133)

![Screenshot of final design of the website for tablet using Figma.](README-images/figma-design-tablet-one.png)
![Screenshot of final design of the website for tablet using Figma.](README-images/figma-design-tablet-two.png)
![Screenshot of final design of the website for tablet using Figma.](README-images/figma-design-tablet-three.png)

#### Desktop (1440x1024)

![Screenshot of final design of the website for desktop using Figma.](README-images/figma-design-desktop-one.png)
![Screenshot of final design of the website for desktop using Figma.](README-images/figma-design-desktop-two.png)
![Screenshot of final design of the website for desktop using Figma.](README-images/figma-design-desktop-three.png)

For the font, I used the Baskervville and Marcellus font families. The text was in black and white colours depending on what background colour the section had. All the sections had contrast between each other as well.

#### Things that were changed while developing the website

* The hero image on a landing page looks different in the deployed version as the first image that I used turned out to be very pixelated. It also has a lot more space around it in tablet and desktop versions.
* The images in the Biography section for desktop have some space around them for stylistic purpose.
* The work section for desktop no white background as there is no need to add that much negative space.
* The quotes section for tablet and desktop looks different as I decided to center the image.
* There is no white background in the subscribe section as I thought there is no need for contrast there.
* The footer doesn't have text next to the social media icons as I thought it was unnecessary to add it.

![Manual testing](README-images/manual-testing.png)

#### Screen sizes

The website works well and is responsive on the following mobile devices and tablets:

* Samsung Galaxy A51
* Samsung Galaxy A34
* OPPO A12
* Moto G Power
* iPhone XR
* iPhone 12 Pro
* Samsung Galaxy S8+
* Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
* iPad Air
* iPad Mini

### Browsers

The website works in the following browsers:

* Chrome
* Opera
* Microsoft Edge

In Firefox, the images in Home and Quotes sections are stretched. The images in Work section are smaller than they should be.

### Unfixed Bugs

* The links in navbar menu when clicked don't stay underlined when user is in particular section. I have tried different things to make them work but unfortunately I wasn't able to do that. I guess I need JavaScript for it.
* When you user clicks on "Go to Home page" button in Thank You page, it brings they back to index.html page but the header is hidden and doesn't have a fixed position. It all goes back to how it should be only when the page is refreshed. I couldn't find a reason to that as "Go to Home page" is correctly connected to index.html.

### Fixed Bugs

* I had a problem with h2 headings of my sections. They wouldn't show up once you clicked on the link in navbar menu. My groupmate Oleksiy Lazarenko helped with that by suggesting adding scroll-padding-top to the asterisk selector.
