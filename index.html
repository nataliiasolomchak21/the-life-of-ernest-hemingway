                        <p>Ernest Hemingway was born in 1899 and the eldest son to a wealthy family. Although he grew up in the suburbs of Chicago,
                        Hemingway has written fondly about his childhood summers in Walloon Lake, Michigan.</p>

                        shell and wounded. He was awarded an Italian Medal of Valor for his service. His time during the war later served as

                        <p>In the late '30s, war once again called to Hemingwayâ€”but he wouldn't be fighting this time. Instead, Hemingway used his
                        journalistic skills and high profile to cover the events of the Spanish Civil War. He sent more than 30 dispatches and
                        produced the film The Spanish Earth in support of Spain's Republican party.</p>
